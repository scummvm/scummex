If you have read some of the specifications of SCUMM blocks, you'll notice
that they don't all include their size in the same way. In order to find
the next block when analyzing (and in order to dump to files and process
blocks correctly) SCUMM Revisited has to know the size of the current one.
Thus, it needs to know the size format of each block. Just for those
interested in internal stuff, here is a list of the different size formats
used by SCUMM - and SCUMM Revisited:<P>

<B>Standard:</B> The format I have chosen to call &quot;Standard&quot; is
the one most commonly used in blocks for newer SCUMM games. All of these
blocks start with four characters containing the block type (e.g. &quot;LECF&quot;)
followed by four bytes containing the size in little endian format
(e.g. 00 01 32 2F - a size of 78383 bytes). These eight bytes are included
in the size.<P>

<B>Name and Size not Included:</B> This format is almost the same as the
Standard format. The only difference is that here, the eight bytes containing
the block type and size are not included in the size. So to get the correct
size of the block we add 8.<P>

<B>Name and Size not Included - Inconsistent:</B> This format is the same
as the one described right above, except that sometimes this block has one
more byte than the size says.<P>

<B>Undefined - Based on Parent or Filesize:</B> Some blocks do not contain
any useable size information at all. An example is the Creative Voice File
blocks. Creative Voice Files (.voc) do not contain any information on their
own size, which is probably why LEC placed those files within a wrapper
block named VTLK for Full Throttle . Luckily, there is usually always a
way to find the size anyway. Some blocks are known to be the root blocks of
a file, and thus are just set to the size of the resource file. Others are
always the last blocks within a parent block, and thus the size can be
derived from the parent block size, by subtracting the size of all other
sub-blocks (i.e. the offset of the current block, relative to the parent
block offset) from the size of the parent.<P>

<B>Entry Based:</B> Some blocks, such as MCMP and COMP, contain their sizes
not in bytes, but in entries. So, to get the byte size, we multiply the size of
each entry with the number of entries and add the 8 starting bytes mentioned
above + the bytes containing the number of entries.<P>

<B>Directory Table:</B> In bundle files, the block types/names and sizes of
the contained files are listed in a directory at the start of the bundle file.
This size format is used for such blocks.<P>

<B>Old SCUMM:</B> For the early games Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and
Secret of Monkey Island, the entire file format was quite different: Each
block started with the four bytes containing the size of the block in <I>big</I>
endian followed by <I>two</I> characters for the block type identifier.<P>

<B>VOC:</B> The Creative Voice Files (.voc) do not contain any info on
size, which is the reason why MONSTER.SOU files take so long to analyze.
In order to find the size, SCUMM Revisited parses the file's data in
order to find the end of the file.<P>

<B>Unknown:</B> Unknown is used for blocks that SCUMM Revisited does not
know of. Other than displaying &quot;Unknown&quot; in the info panel, I
decided to let this format be the same as the Undefined format, which is
the safest and will allow more files to be opened that SCUMM Revisited was
not made for ;)<P>
