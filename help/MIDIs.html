From Monkey Island 2 and until Sam & Max Hit the Road, LEC used
MIDI files for the music in the adventure games (with a few
exceptions), because the <I>i</I>MUSE system that was developed
for Monkey Island 2 used this format.<P>

Each game usually has the MIDIs saved in different versions for
different types of sound devices: PC speaker, Adlib, Roland MT-32
etc. Each of these versions had their own block type:<P>

<A HREF="specSPK.html">SPK</A> for the PC speaker.<BR>
<A HREF="specADL.html">ADL</A> for Adlib MIDI files.<BR>
<A HREF="specROL.html">ROL</A> for Roland MT-32 files.<BR>
<A HREF="specAMI.html">AMI</A> for Amiga MIDI files.<BR>
<A HREF="specGMD.html">GMD</A> and <A HREF="specMIDI.html">MIDI</A>
for General MIDI files.

<P>
If you can find a MIDI or GMD version of a piece of music, as a rule
of thumb, that will be the most detailed version. If not, try to find
a ROL version. Sometimes this varies, though. Land composed the Monkey
Island 2 theme for the Adlib, later converting it to MT-32 for the
game, while the rest of the game's music was composed for MT-32 (as
most of the MI music is).<P>

When listening to this music, you will find some things that may seem
odd to you:<P>

<UL>
<LI>On ADL and SPK tracks, the music only plays back with piano
and drums (or some other weird instruments)! This is because the ADL,
SPK and SPK MIDIs don't have any instrument info embedded. You may add
your own in a sequencing program, of course.
<LI>On ROL, the instruments sound all wrong! This is because the Roland MT-32
uses a different set of instruments than the General MIDI standard.
This means that when a file made for MT-32 tells the MIDI device to
change to instrument 27, for example, it means that it wants the
instrument known as Synth Brass 3 - but in General MIDI instrument 27
is a Jazz Guitar! If you know your patch maps, you can make a relatively
good General MIDI version of a Roland MIDI. If you don't, do not ask me
how to do it! Go find converted MIDIs on the web instead, at HighLand
Productions or Quest Studios.
(Or, go buy an MT-32 :) Don't ask me how to do it. I won't tell you.
<LI>On AMI tracks, the instruments sound all wrong too! This is because the
Amiga games most likely had a software sequencer. The instruments are stored
elsewhere. As with the ROL MIDIs, you may be able to make a relatively good
General MIDI version of an Amiga MIDI.
<LI>On many cues, the music sounds mixed up completely! This is due to
the way <I>i</I>MUSE works. One MIDI file contains many different cues
to be mixed together by <I>i</I>MUSE. These are stored &quot;on top of eachother&quot;,
in the Standard MIDI format 2, which means that each track contains a
different cue. Obviously, when all these different cues are played at the
same time, the result is not necessarily nice :) So, if you want listenable
files from these, you'll have to load them into a sequencer, split the
tracks apart, and mix them like iMUSE does. Do not ask me how to do this
either! The MIDIs found at HighLand Productions or Quest Studios will be
mixed correctly.
