<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">

Each block specification contains a general description of the block and
a table of the exact ordering of data within the block. The first column
in these tables either contains a string literal (for example the block
name &quot;APAL&quot;) or an identifier (made up by me) written in
hungarian notation.<P>

The second column contains the size/format of the data meaning the
following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>byte - Yep, a byte.
<LI>word - 2 bytes
<LI>dword - 4 bytes
<LI>char - basically a byte, but used for character contents.
<LI>string - null-terminated string, i.e. a string of chars ended with a
    byte of the value 0. Normally, char will be used for strings containing
    a known number of chars, while string will be used where the length
    of the string is variable.
<LI>block - SCUMM format block.
</UL>
Some of these may be prepended a multiplier, such as &quot;5 *&quot;, which
means what you think it does.<P>

The third column contains a description of the data. In this, some
abbreviations are used:<P>

<UL>
<LI>BE - Big Endian, i.e. the number is stored with the most significant
    byte <B>first</B> (as most normal people would write it, no offense to Intel).
    Also known as Motorola format.
<LI>LE - Little Endian, i.e. the number is stored with the most significant
    byte <B>last</B>. Also known as Intel format.
</UL>

If nothing is noted, the number is stored as Big Endian.<P>

Special schemes are used for special instances, such as a piece of the spec
being repeated for a specified number of times:<BR>
<B>loop <<I>count</I>></B><BR>
&nbsp;...<BR>
<B>end of loop</B><P>

- or an unspecified number of times:<BR>
<B>loop</B><BR>
&nbsp;...<BR>
<B>end of loop</B><P>

Also, if a piece of the spec may not occur in some instances, it's marked
thusly:<BR>

<B>(</B><BR>
&nbsp;...<BR>
<B>)</B><P>

Finally, if a piece can be different in some instances, it's marked with:<BR>
<B>{</B><BR>
&nbsp;...<BR>
<B>}<BR>
or<BR>
{</B><BR>
&nbsp;...<BR>
<B>}</B><P>
