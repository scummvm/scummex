(<I>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</I>, CDROM version of <I>Loom</I>, <I>Secret of Monkey Island</I>)<P>
With <I>Indy3</I>, the file format used for SCUMM started to be standardized.
Rather than just having all the data stored in a huge mess, LucasFilm Games
started to use a format reminiscent of the IFF format (they would get
even closer to IFF with MI2 and later games - the
&quot;<A HREF="newfrmt.html">New SCUMM File Format</A>&quot;).<P>

The file format is built up of <I>blocks</I>, each having a name and a size.
The size is stored first, as a dword (four bytes), little endian.

After that follows the block name, as two characters, for example
&quot;LE&quot;. After these 6 bytes comes the block data.<P>

The size mentioned before includes the 6 bytes making up the size and the
name as well as the size of the data following these 6 bytes. Example:<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<PRE>
08 00 00 00 &quot;B&quot; &quot;X&quot; 00 01
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>
... would be an entire block, the size is 8 - the four bytes, the two
characters, and the two bytes of data.

The new format was hierarchal, blocks could be contained within other blocks
to give the file more structure. Storing a block within another simply meant
putting the block within the other's data area - i.e. right after the first 6
bytes of the parent block - or in some rare instances, a having some data and
then a subblock. As long as the block is stored within the size of the parent
block, we call it a subblock. Normally, additional subblocks will be stored
right after the end of the previous block. The scheme of a standard block
thus looks like this:<P>

In the early games, the first block is an RO (room) block, containing
other blocks describing the room, such as BX (boxes), OI (object images)
etc. After the RO block, within the same file, is the global scripts
for the room (SC), the sound (SO) etc. With <I>MI1</I> the programmers
started to bundle the files for each room into a big disc-sized file. The
basics of the format is still the same, but rather than having a
structure like this:<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<PRE>
RO
 HD
 CC
 SP
 BX
 ...
SC
SC
SO
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>
(where HD, CC, SP etc. are subblocks of the RO block)... it would be like
this:<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<PRE>
LE
 FO
 LF
  RO
   HD
   CC
   ...
  SC
  SC
  SO
 LF
  RO
   HD
   ...
etc.

To give an example, the start of a file structured like this would look
something like this (taken from the disk01.lec file of the PC version of
<I>MI1</I>):<P>
