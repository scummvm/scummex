RIFF signifies a standard Windows RIFF WAV file (check any WAV file format
specification for more info), but when used in GrimE the file has been
compressed (usually starting from the 8th byte of the data chunk - the actual
pcm data) in accordance with the <A HREF="specMCMP.html">MCMP</A> block.
However, if no such file is found in the .WAV file (such as in <I>Phantom
Menace</I> and some instances in <I>Grim Fandango</I>), the file is likely to be uncompressed (but may follow a special
scheme when dealing with a 12 bit WAV).
