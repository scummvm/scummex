In this section, you will find a small bit of the info I have gathered for
the making of SCUMM Revisited. That is, specifics on each
<A HREF="spec.html">block</A> used in the SCUMM resource files.
Also, a list of CMI script opcodes is given. There are still a lot of gaps
in these pages - I'll add more as I get the time (but only if people actually
request more of it). Some stuff, such as decompression algorithms, I have
left out on purpose, mainly to allow them to stay LucasArts secrets.<P>
